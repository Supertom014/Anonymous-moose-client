Anonymous-mouse-client
===============

The client component for the Anonymous-mouse chat system.

For use in conjunction with the server component. An example settings.ini file is included in the resource folder. The settings.zip file is also included to show example configurations. It's password is 'thomas', the password is only there to stop casual snoopers. Use a program such as 7-zip to create a new passworded settings.zip containing all the same files. The server_public_key.pem file should contain a pem formatted public key for the server. In settings.ini: The 'inter_com' service login is required. Menus within the chat menu are populated from the other files in settings.zip. The file 'example menu item.txt' shows the formatting: first line is menu name, a blank line, name of menu item, text to insert. Four items are included in the example file to demonstrate the formatting. The menu files are loaded in alphanumeric order, so it's advised to put a number at the begining of each file name.
